CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is a parallel computing platform and application programming interface (API) model created by Nvidia.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA

* Code written on NVIDIA Cuda Runtime 10.2

* Tested on Quadro M2000M

Implemented & measured:

1. Polynomial calculation on CPU & GPU (part of the code was provided by an academic teacher)
2. Image gray scaling on CPU & GPU
3. Matrix multiplication on CPU & GPU (how the loop rolling/unrolling performed by the NVCC compiler affects the time it takes to perform  calculations)

_Tasks that have been completed here and theoretical introduction to laboratories was developed by IT engineer and academic teacher - Slawomir Wernikowski at the West Pomeranian University of Technology_
